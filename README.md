# pi-autotrain — autonomous fine-tuning loop for pi

**[Install](#install)** · **[Usage](#usage)** · **[How it works](#how-it-works)**

*Detect hardware, pick framework, curate data, train LoRA adapters, optimize through structured phases — all autonomously.*

A specialized [autoresearch](https://github.com/karpathy/autoresearch) variant for LLM fine-tuning. Instead of generic optimization, autotrain encodes fine-tuning domain knowledge: experiment phase ordering (data > format > architecture > hyperparameters), three-way data splits, overfitting detection, anti-thrash safeguards, and automatic HuggingFace Hub integration.

## What's included

| | |
|---|---|
| **Extension** | Tools + live widget + `/autotrain` dashboard |
| **Skill** | Detects hardware, selects framework, creates data splits, writes session files, starts the fine-tuning loop |

### Extension tools

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `init_experiment` | One-time session config — name, metric, unit, direction |
| `run_experiment` | Runs any command, times wall-clock duration, captures output |
| `log_experiment` | Records result, auto-commits, updates widget and dashboard |

### Supported frameworks

| Framework | Hardware | Notes |
|-----------|----------|-------|
| **mlx-lm** | Apple Silicon Mac | Native Metal acceleration, unified memory |
| **unsloth** | NVIDIA GPU | 2-5x faster than TRL, 50-70% less VRAM |
| **TRL + PEFT** | NVIDIA GPU (fallback) | When unsloth doesn't support the model |

Hardware is auto-detected at session start. The agent picks the best framework automatically.

### HuggingFace integration

After every successful experiment (`keep`):
- Adapter uploaded to HF Hub
- Session notes synced
- Model card created and updated with results table

### Skill

`autotrain-create` gathers your goal, base model, dataset, and constraints — then:

1. Detects hardware and selects framework
2. Creates a three-way data split (train/val/test)
3. Writes session files and commits them
4. Runs a baseline and starts the optimization loop

### Session files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `autotrain.md` | Living session document — objective, hardware, metrics, data splits, phase ordering, anti-thrash rules, what's been tried. A fresh agent can resume from this alone. |
| `autotrain.sh` | Training + evaluation script — pre-checks, trains the model, evaluates on test split, outputs `METRIC name=number` lines. |
| `autotrain.checks.sh` | *(optional)* Backpressure checks — correctness validation that blocks `keep` on failure. |

## Install

```bash
pi install https://github.com/gary149/autotrain
```

<details>
<summary>Manual install</summary>

```bash
cp -r extensions/pi-autotrain ~/.pi/agent/extensions/
cp -r skills/autotrain-create ~/.pi/agent/skills/
```

Then `/reload` in pi.

## Usage

### 1. Start autotrain

```
/skill:autotrain-create
```

The agent asks about your goal, base model, dataset, and constraints. It then:
- Detects your hardware (Apple Silicon or NVIDIA)
- Selects the best framework (mlx-lm, unsloth, or TRL)
- Creates train/val/test splits
- Writes `autotrain.md` and `autotrain.sh`
- Commits everything
- Runs the baseline and starts looping

### 2. The structured loop

Autotrain follows a **strict phase order**:

```
Phase 1: Data Quality        ← HIGHEST leverage, explore first
Phase 2: Prompt & Output Format
Phase 3: LoRA Architecture
Phase 4: Training Hyperparameters
Phase 5: Regularization      ← only if overfitting visible
```

The agent won't jump to hyperparameter tuning before exhausting data and format improvements. This prevents the most common fine-tuning mistake: tweaking learning rates when the training data needs curation.

### 3. Anti-thrash safeguards

The agent monitors its own progress and self-corrects:
- **5+ consecutive discards** → pivots to a different phase
- **Same metric for 8+ runs** → makes a structural change
- **Stuck on Phase 4** → goes back to Phases 1-3
- **20+ minutes without improvement** → runs fresh validation, then pivots

### 4. Validation protocol

Three-way split prevents overfitting:
- **Train** — gradient updates
- **Val** — checkpoint selection during training
- **Test** — keep/discard decisions (fixed, never modified)

Plus **fresh validation** every 10 experiments to catch overfitting to the test set.

### 5. Monitor progress

- **Widget** — always visible above the editor
- **`/autotrain`** — full dashboard with results table
- **`Escape`** — interrupt anytime

## Example session

```
> /skill:autotrain-create

Goal: Chess move prediction from FEN positions
Base model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-3B
Dataset: lichess_games_2024.csv (1.2M games)

🔍 Hardware detected: Apple M2 Max 64GB → using mlx-lm
📊 Created splits: train=50K, val=5K, test=2K
📝 Wrote autotrain.md, autotrain.sh
✓ Committed initial setup

Phase 1: Data Quality
  #1  baseline          exact_accuracy=8.47%    keep
  #2  filter ELO>1500   exact_accuracy=12.3%    keep  ← data curation wins
  #3  filter ELO>1800   exact_accuracy=11.1%    discard (too little data)
  #4  dedup positions   exact_accuracy=14.2%    keep

Phase 2: Prompt Format
  #5  SAN instead of UCI  exact_accuracy=18.6%  keep  ← format matters
  #6  add piece counts    exact_accuracy=18.4%  discard

Phase 3: LoRA Architecture
  #7  rank 16→32        exact_accuracy=19.1%    keep

Phase 4: Training Hyperparameters
  #8  LR 1e-5→6e-5     exact_accuracy=22.0%    keep
  ...
```

## How it works

The **extension** is domain-agnostic infrastructure. The **skill** encodes fine-tuning domain knowledge. This separation means the extension handles all the plumbing (git, metrics, dashboard) while the skill knows about LoRA, data splits, and training frameworks.

```
┌──────────────────────┐     ┌────────────────────────────────┐
│  Extension (global)  │     │  Skill (fine-tuning domain)    │
│                      │     │                                │
│  run_experiment      │◄────│  framework: mlx-lm / unsloth   │
│  log_experiment      │     │  phases: data > format > arch   │
│  widget + dashboard  │     │  validation: 3-way split        │
│                      │     │  anti-thrash: self-monitoring   │
└──────────────────────┘     └────────────────────────────────┘
```

Two files keep the session alive across restarts and context resets:

```
autotrain.jsonl      — append-only log of every run (metric, status, commit, description)
autotrain.md         — living document: objective, hardware, phases, what's been tried
```

A fresh agent with no memory can read these two files and continue exactly where the previous session left off.

---

## Backpressure checks (optional)

Create `autotrain.checks.sh` to run correctness checks after every passing benchmark.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -euo pipefail
python -m pytest tests/ -x --tb=short 2>&1 | tail -50
```

If checks fail, the experiment is logged as `checks_failed` — no commit, revert changes.
